# f17-capstone-project

The technologies I used for this app are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also used Bootstrap and implemented a free theme from the website Bootswatch. 

I chose this app idea because I’m passionate about how the “med tech” industry helps people with chronic pain and illness track their health data. Tracking helps people pinpoint exactly which factors are making their health better or worse.

I put a lot of thought into the User Experience. Since people with chronic pain already face huge obstacles in getting through an average day, they need an app’s UX to provide a welcome relief. They don’t need yet another burden, so the app needs to be easy and rewarding to use so they have an incentive to be consistent with it.

This is why I used a minimalist Bootstrap theme and added a background image of the ocean, so the app would look and feel refreshing for users. 

First feature – Create a new pain log
I used Axios to send requests to the server

Second feature – Get all past pain logs
I used Express to create the server

Third feature – Delete a pain log

Fourth feature – The app is connected to an external database on heroku, so the data persists when you refresh the page.

Fifth feature – The app uses bootstrap, so it has responsive sizing.
